# Clancy of the Overflow

_by [Banjo Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo_Paterson)_

>Clancy of the Overflow was inspired by an experience Banjo Paterson had while he was working as a lawyer. He was asked to write to a man named Thomas Gerald Clancy to ask for a payment that had not been received. Banjo sent the letter to 'The Overflow' and received the reply: 'Clancy's gone to Queensland droving and we don't know where he are.'

### First verse 

1. I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better 

1. Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,

1. He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,

1. Just "on spec", addressed as follows: **"Clancy, of The Overflow"**.
