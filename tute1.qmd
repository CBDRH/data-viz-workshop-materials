Today we will learn about forest plots. @cr-blank

Here is a forest plot published in the journal Circulation @cr-myimage

This plot type combines a typical table structure... [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="30%, 20%" scale-by="1.4"}

...together with a scatterplot of hazard ratios together with confidence intervals [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="-30%, 20%" scale-by="1.4"}

Notice that I have included arrows which help the reader to interpret the direction of effects. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="-30%, -80%" scale-by="1.4"}

The end of the third and fourth line also rhyme and are nudged in a bit. [@cr-limerick]{highlight="3-4"}

| There was a young rustic named [Mallory]{#cr-mallory},
| who drew but a very small [salary]{#cr-salary}.

The end of the first two lines of a Limerick must rhyme. [@cr-limerick]{highlight="cr-mallory,cr-salary"}

This is the first limerick ever recorded. @cr-limerick
